Hello, fellow gamer. If you are here reading this that means you are absolutely
retarded. My game instincts are telling me that writing this post will give me
gamer points and will help with getting a gamer victory royale.

Universe with zero curvature. In a universe with zero curvature, the local geometry is flat.
The most obvious global structure is that of Euclidean space, which is infinite in extent.
Flat universes that are finite in extent include the torus and Klein bottle.

I am aware that I am spewing cryptic nonsense but that is none of my concern.
I also like loli's since they are cute and lewdable.

I might make a post in the future describing how wonderful a loli is and its perks.
That is all for this gamer post thank you for reading my fellow gamer.
