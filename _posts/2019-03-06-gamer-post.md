<p>Hello, fellow gamer.</p>
<p>If you are here reading this that means you are absolutely retarded.</p>
<p>My game instincts are telling me that writing this post will give me gamer points and will help with getting a gamer victory royale.</p>
<p>Universe with zero curvature. In a universe with zero curvature, the local geometry is flat.</p>
<p>The most obvious global structure is that of Euclidean space, which is infinite in extent.</p>
<p>Flat universes that are finite in extent include the torus and Klein bottle.</p>
<p>I am aware that I am spewing cryptic nonsense but that is none of my concern.</p>
<p>I also like loli's since they are cute and lewdable.</p>
<p>I might make a post in the future describing the greatness of a loli.</p>
<p>That is all for this gamer post thank you for reading my fellow gamer.</p>
